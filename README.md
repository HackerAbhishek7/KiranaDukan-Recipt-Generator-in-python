# KiranaDukan-Recipt-Generator-in-python


This is a simple mini-project developed in python
in order to be used by our local shopkeepper to 
calculate the bills: 

1. Just clone the repository
2. Install python3 interprator
3. Run "Python3 KiranDukan.py"

Note: it will not run in python2. Since, f strings are supported in later version of python
